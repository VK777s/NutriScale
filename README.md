# NutriScale: A Python-Based Diet & Nutrition Tracker üçé

NutriScale is a full-featured, GUI-based nutrition management system built with Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib. It provides a complete solution for users to track their dietary intake, log meals, and visualize progress toward their weight goals.

It also features a separate, comprehensive admin panel for managing the application's food database and user accounts.

## Features

The project is split into two main applications: the **Client Portal** and the **Admin Panel**.

### üîë Client Portal (`nutriscale_app.py`)

* **Secure Authentication:** Users can create a secure account (username/password) and log in.
* **Personalized Profile:** On signup, users provide their age, weight, height, and activity level to calculate:
    * Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
    * Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
    * A target daily calorie goal (deficit/surplus).
* **Daily Meal Logging:** Users can search the food database, enter a quantity (in grams), and log it to their daily journal.
* **Smart Food Recommendations:** A recommendation engine suggests meal/snack ideas (with quantities) based on the user's remaining calories for the day.
* **Progress Dashboard:** Users can visualize their progress with two dynamic charts:
    * A line chart tracking weight changes over time.
    * A bar chart comparing daily calorie intake against their target.

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Panel (`admin_app.py`)

* **Tabbed Interface:** A clean, tabbed GUI for simple management.
* **Food Database Management (CRUD):**
    * **Create:** Add new food items with full nutritional data (calories, protein, carbs, fats).
    * **Read:** View the entire food database in a sortable list.
    * **Update:** Select a food to auto-fill its data, make changes, and save.
    * **Delete:** Remove food items from the database.
* **User Management:**
    * View a list of all registered users and their profile details (username, name, goals, etc.).
    * Delete users from the system. This also performs a "cascading delete" to remove all of their associated meal logs and weight history.

## üöÄ Technical Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **GUI:** Tkinter (via `ttk` for modern styling)
* **Database:** SQLite 3 (for all user, food, and log data)
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib (embedded directly into the Tkinter GUI)

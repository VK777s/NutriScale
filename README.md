# NutriScale
Concept:  The goal is to recommend food choices that help someone reach their target weight. 
The food suggestions could depend on:  
Current weight  
Target weight  
Caloric requirements (caloric deficit or surplus based on weight goal) 
Macronutrient balance (protein, carbs, fats)

# Project overview
NutriScale is a simple Python-based nutrition recommendation tool designed to help users achieve their target weight goals.
By taking inputs such as current weight, target weight, and activity level, the program calculates the daily calorie requirement and provides suggestions for foods that support either a caloric deficit (for weight loss) or caloric surplus (for weight gain).
It helps users maintain a balanced diet by considering macronutrients ‚Äî protein, carbohydrates, and fats ‚Äî to ensure healthy progress toward their fitness goals.

# Features
üßÆ Calculates daily calorie needs using user input (current and target weight).

üçé Suggests food options for both weight loss and weight gain.

üìä Provides approximate macronutrient (protein, carbs, fat) distribution.

üïí Simple, interactive console-based interface.

üí° Can be easily expanded with a food database or API integration later.

# Prerequisite
Before running the program, make sure you have:
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Basic understanding of Python input/output and conditional statements.

# Usage
Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
Enter your current weight, target weight, and activity level when prompted.
The program will calculate your daily calorie goal.
It will recommend a list of foods or meals to help reach your goal (e.g., high-protein foods for muscle gain or low-calorie foods for fat loss).
Review the suggestions and adjust your diet plan accordingly.

# knowledge gained about using Python 
Through this project, you will learn:
How to handle user input and conditional logic in Python.
Basic principles of calorie balance and macronutrient distribution.
How to design a simple console-based user interface.
How to use functions to structure a real-world Python application.
